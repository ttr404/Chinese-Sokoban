## How to Play
In this game, players control a main character navigating through various levels, each with its own set of challenges and puzzles reminiscent of the classic Sokoban game. The primary objective is to push boxes to designated target points on the map to progress through levels.

As you advance, the game introduces new elements and challenges to test your puzzle-solving abilities. From Level 3 onwards, a second character comes into play, adding an extra layer of strategy as you'll need to maneuver both the main character and this new character to their respective targets.

Successfully completing all target points within a level triggers the game to automatically advance to the next level after a brief 2-second interval. Should you find yourself in a situation where completion becomes impossible, or if you wish to retry the level for any reason, you have the option to restart the current level.

### Controls
- Arrow Keys: Move the player in the desired direction. Use the up, down, left, and right arrows to navigate the game area.
- R Key: Restart the current level. Use this control if you need to reset the level's puzzles 
- Special Note:
From Level 3, you'll encounter a second character. Control this character by first moving adjacent to them. Once close, your movements will also influence their position, allowing you to guide them to their target alongside managing the main character and the boxes.
